Ultralight is a simple tool to help novice web developers make simple client-side web apps that have stateful URLs, basic templating, and *that's it*.

## Why are we doing this?

Scientists are beginning to realize the power and convenience of sharing tools and analyses via simple web apps. But, most labs don't have the budget to hire a full-time web developer, and most scientists are not web developers. As such, the powerful professional frameworks out there often produce products that are too cumbersome to maintain.

Ultralight seeks to allow users with a casual commitment to web development to make simple applications that nonetheless capture a few best practices, like html templates and meaningful URLs.
