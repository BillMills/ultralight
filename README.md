**[Testing status](http://billmills.github.io/ultralight/tests/tests.html)**

Ultralight is a simple tool to help novice web developers make simple client-side web apps that have stateful URLs, basic templating, and *that's it*. You can see a demo of Ultralight in action right here on the [gh-pages branch](http://billmills.github.io/ultralight/index.html?cats=1).

## Why are we doing this?

Scientists are beginning to realize the power and convenience of sharing tools and analyses via simple web apps. But, most labs don't have the budget to hire a full-time web developer, and most scientists are not web developers. As such, the powerful professional frameworks out there often produce products that are too cumbersome to maintain.

Ultralight seeks to allow users with a casual commitment to web development to make simple applications that nonetheless capture a few best practices, like html templates and meaningful URLs.

## Contributing

Ultralight is a simple sketch at the moment. A huge help would be to open an issue with your comments or ideas, or participate in one of the ongoing conversation there.

## Thanks

The templating half of ultralight is nothing but [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) - big thanks to that team!
